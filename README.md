# Homework 2

In this homework we are creating a React version of the 311 service request app.

## Bundler

In the previous homework we didn't use a bundler of any sort - the only client side JavaScript was a single file that you served directly to the client. In this assignment, we are using the Vite bundler with ES Modules.
